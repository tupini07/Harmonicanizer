# Harmonicanizer

I'm learning to play the chomatic harmonica, and reading music sheets is not
hard but I've found it to be an unnecessarily long process to transcribe music
sheets to harmonica holes. So I wrote a program to do it for me!

**NOTE:** This is still under development and is not usable by any means.

<!-- TODO add specification -->

Currently the program supports reading _Harmonicanizer Notation_ and outputs
chromatic harmonica notation. In the future the idea is to also allow it to
output diatonic harmonica notation as well.
